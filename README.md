## The landing page for most of my GitHub projects.

I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, a front end web developer. However, a variety of work projects and my growing interest in Data Science make it clear that I should have a web presence. I do have a [Data Science](http://adventuresindata.science) blog, maintained through GitHub, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and [blogdown](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io). This page is to help navigating to presentations and side projects.
